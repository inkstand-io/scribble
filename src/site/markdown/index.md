Scribble-Modules
================

Since version 0.3 Scribble has been modularized so that it more easy to use it in project and it no longer would
add loads of dependencies into your project, that you don't need.

You may combine these modules, and some of the module have dependencies on each other. If you require all modules,
you may just add the _scribble-all_ dependency and you're all set.
